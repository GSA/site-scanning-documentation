An important principle of the Site Scanning project is to identify specific programs and people within TTS, GSA, and the wider government that our scans can deliver real value to.  Asking these users what data would be useful to them and how we can iterate these scans and report pages is key to this program's success.  

We consider an active stakeholder to be a person or team that actively use our program data.  

## Active Stakeholder Relationships

Here's the programs that are currently identified as active stakeholders that are using our scans and from whom we are soliciting feedback on each iteration.   

#### OMB Office of the Federal CIO
* The Federal Website Index, DAP compliance, and USWDS compliance are used to implement and track compliance for 21st Century IDEA.
* Site Scanning data is being used to populate a d2d dashboard used by OFCIO and the DX Council.  
* Site Scanning data is being used for the Public Web Rationalization effort.

#### The Digital Analytics Program 

They use Site Scanning data to:
- Identify federal websites that have not installed DAP
- Identify federal websites that have out of date or misconfigured DAP implementations.
- Compare agency adoption of DAP vs. Google Analytics more broadly.
- Track adoption of code updates.  

They want to know:  
- Which websites have DAP on them.  
- How are those website's DAP code configured.
- Which websites have GA on them.  


#### Search.gov 

- They are using Site Scanning data to track adoption and understand their market.  

#### USWDS Team 
- They are using Site Scanning data to track adoption and qualify different levels of implementation.
