An important principle of the Site Scanning project is to identify specific programs and people within TTS, GSA, and the wider government that our scans can deliver real value to.  Asking these users what data would be useful to them and how we can iterate these scans and report pages is key to this program's success.  

We consider an active stakeholder to be a person or team that actively use our program data.  

## Active Stakeholder Relationships

Here's the programs that are currently identified as active stakeholders that are using our scans and from whom we are soliciting feedback on each iteration.   

#### The Digital Analytics Program 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) of the DAP scan data. 
* Next, we intend to:
  * Propose a report page at analytics.usa.gov/participation that shows current progress in implementing DAP (along the lines that pulse.cio.gov used to provide).  
  * Use the results of the [quality assessment](/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) to further refine the scan methodology.  

#### Search.gov 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for search related data that the program needs.  
* We've [solicited feedback from the search.gov team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdRXgFYRGBASjJ5FEFwLUEksJIk8YxbTSGspVxrdctU/edit) and identified from them what data they most need from us that they don't yet have.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Use the results of the feedback session to expand what is scanned.  
  * Perform a quality assessment to further refine the scan methodology.  


#### USWDS Team 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for USWDS implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/scans/qa_analysis/uswds-scan-7-20.md) of the USWDS scan data. 
* Next, we intend to:
  * Use the results of the quality assessment (link needed) to further refine the scan methodology.  


#### TTS Digital Council

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.) 
  
#### DigitalDashboard.gov

* We've solicited feedback from the digitaldashboarde.gov team and identified from them what data they most need from us that they don't yet have.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Restart fresh subdomain list generation.  

#### GSA Digital Council 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP and USWDS implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.)   

#### GSA IPv6 Migration Team
* We've built an MVP of this and delivered it to the interested team.  

#### National Institute of Standards and Technology
* We've built a scan that detects the presence of certain required hyperlinks.
