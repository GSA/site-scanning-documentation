An important principle of the Site Scanning project is to identify specific programs and people within TTS, GSA, and the wider government that our scans can deliver real value to.  Asking these users what data would be useful to them and how we can iterate these scans and report pages is key to this program's success.  

We consider an active stakeholder to be a person or team that actively use our program data.  

## Active Stakeholder Relationships

Here's the programs that are currently identified as active stakeholders that are using our scans and from whom we are soliciting feedback on each iteration.   

#### The Digital Analytics Program 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) of the DAP scan data. 

#### Search.gov 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for search related data that the program needs.  
* We've [solicited feedback from the search.gov team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdRXgFYRGBASjJ5FEFwLUEksJIk8YxbTSGspVxrdctU/edit) and identified from them what data they most need from us that they don't yet have.  

#### USWDS Team 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for USWDS implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/scans/qa_analysis/uswds-scan-7-20.md) of the USWDS scan data. 

#### Touchpoints
* The site uses much of the available data in Site Scanning for its [statuscard pages](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/admin/websites/252/statuscard)

#### TTS Digital Council

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.

#### DigitalDashboard.gov

* The site uses our Federal Website Index, DAP data, and USWDS data.  

#### GSA Digital Council

#### GSA IPv6 Migration Team
* We've built an MVP of this and delivered it to the interested team.

#### GSA 10x Privacy-protected Engagement With Online Government Services 
* We've built a scan that captures [the cookies being used on each site](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/pull/254).
