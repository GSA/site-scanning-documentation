## About the Site Scanning program

The Site Scanning program is a website scanner for federal government professionals. Excellent federal websites lead to the delivery of excellent digital services for the public and public servants. This program gives you instant access to data on the big picture of what's working really well on federal websites. Data indicating the most critical web hygiene and user-friendly features present on a federal website. These top features of excellence are distilled from industry standards, federal laws, and user needs. 

The core of the program is a scanning engine that performs a series of scans that each check for a particular feature on each individual website included in a continuously-updated list of federal domains and subdomains. The system compiles all the scan results into simple data files called JSON. To access these JSON files, users pull the data into their own system using the Site Scanning API, or by engaging directly on a report page.

### Value Proposition

The Site Scanning programs provides the only comprehensive index of federal websites, and generates over 100 data points about each one.  With this data, GSA, OMB, and other agencies can track what and how many public websites each agency operates and offers qualitative metrics for performance, accessibility, compliance, and more.  TTS programs are also able to use Site Scanning data for business intelligence to compute adoption rates and to perform market research.
