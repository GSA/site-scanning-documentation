## Description

Collecting automated real-time data about federal government websites, such as Digital Analytics Program participation and use of the US Web Design System.


## Mission

* To develop and publish the only known authoritative list of public federal government websites. 
* To provide useful analysis of the public federal web presence. 
* To provide irreplaceable business intelligence to TTS programs.  


## Policy Mentions
* "For agencies to maintain a complete understanding of what internet-accessible attack surface they have, they must rely not only on their internal records, but also on external scans of their infrastructure from the internet. CISA will provide data about agencies’ internet-accessible assets obtained through public and private sources. This will include performing scans of agencies’ IT infrastructure. For example, GSA operates a [website scanning service](https://www.digital.gov/site-scanning) that measures a variety of useful properties using open source software collaboratively maintained by CISA and GSA."
