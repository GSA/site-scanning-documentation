,"At noon on a clear summer day in the United States, a flat surface receives about 1000 watts of sunlight per square meter. Traditional dark roofs strongly absorb this sunlight, heating both the building and the surrounding air. This increases energy use in air conditioned buildings, and makes non-air conditioned buildings less comfortable.

See the Subcontractors page for details.   QEW 2 / 3 Job Safety Plan Google Form A Job Safety Plan (JSP) is required for all electrical work here at the Laboratory. Use this electronic JSP form to perform hazard assessments, define controls, and perform a job briefing. Contact any Electrical Safety Officer with questions or comments. QEW 1 Job Safety Plan The new QEW 1 Job Safety Plan (JSP) is now available for use. This easy-to-use JSP captures hazards and controls which are common for QEW 1 level work. Remember, a written Job Safety Plan is required for all electrical work at the Laboratory that involves exposure to electrical hazards. Download and complete the QEW 1 JSP with Adobe Fill & Sign! Electrical Safety Manual, Revision  2 Revision 2, dated 11/25/2019, of the LBNL Electrical Safety Manual is now in place.   This revision is  updated to the 2018 NFPA 70E, recent EFCOG best practices, and other improvements identified by the Electrical Safety Committee.  These include: Incorporates risk assessment terminology, job safety plans and human performance guidelines for Risk Management Added DC arc flash requirements and calculator tool Revised switching rules Added Guidelines and requirements on overdutied panels Added section on Automatic Voltage Testers Added Guidelines on Look-Alike Equipment, Lasers, Welders, and Vaults & Manholes Modifications to Capacitors to match EFCOG submittal to NFPA 70E-2021, and the DOE Electrical Safety Handbook The Electrical Safety Manual is an exhaustive resource that provides the rules and direction for all electrical work at LBNL to keep everyone safe from electrical hazards and meet the requirements of the applicable codes and standards.  Click to download.   Submit Feedback The Electrical Safety Program needs your input and suggestions!   ",,electricalsafety.lbl.gov,Department of Energy,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

Four satellites currently fly in the A-Train - Aqua, CloudSat, CALIPSO, and Aura. GCOM-W1 and OCO-2 are scheduled to join the configuration in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Glory was lost in a launch vehicle failure on March 4, 2011. The 'A-Train' satellites cross the equator within a few minutes of each other at around 1:30 p.m. local time.

Activity detection has been an active research area in computer vision in recent years.

Here, by activity detection, we mean the detection of visual events (people/objects engaged in particular activities) in a large collection of video data.

,"North American ecosystems are critical components of the global carbon cycle. To grow, an ecosystem's plants   use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide and the moisture available to their roots. They also release some carbon   dioxide back into the atmosphere. NASA's AirMOSS radar measures root-zone soil moisture to help determine the overall   carbon exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Flying on a Gulfstream-III (G-III) aircraft, AirMOSS will use   radar to collect soil moisture data from nine climatic habitats in North America to estimate how much carbon the   continent is taking in or releasing to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has an important influence on climate, and the   AirMOSS results will help to improve the accuracy of climate projections for the next 50-100 years.
