## Edit the Federal Website Directory file

#### 1) Make small edits directly 

- Navigate to [the file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-directory/blob/main/us-government-website-directory.csv) in your browswer.
- Click on the pencil in the top right corner.
- Make any necessary changes (note that any field that has commas in it will need to remain wrapped in quotation marks).
- Click 'Commit changes...'.
- Put a quick, cursory note on what you changed in the 'Commit message'
- Click 'Commit changes'


#### 2) Copy and paste the entire file 

- Save your updated data to a csv file on your computer.
- Open the csv file using a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
- Select All.
- Copy
- Open up [the file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-directory/blob/main/us-government-website-directory.csv) in your browswer.
- Click on the pencil in the top right corner.
- Select All.
- Paste.
- Click 'Commit changes...'.
- Put a quick, cursory note on what you changed in the 'Commit message'
- Click 'Commit changes'

#### 3) Update the file using github.dev

- Navigate to [the file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-directory/blob/main/us-government-website-directory.csv) in your browswer.
- Press `.`, opening up the file in github.dev
- Ensure that your updated, local copy is has the exact same filename `us-government-website-directory.csv`.  Drag the file from it's local location in your file explorer to empty space below the filename in the Explorer in the left sidebar of github.dev.
- You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to replace this file.  Click Replace.
- On the left sidebar, click 'Source Control' (4th icon down, should have a one on it right now).
- Put a quick, cursory note on what you changed in the 'Message' box.
- Click 'Commit and Push'.  



Other, less-favored options include: 
- Updating the file using GitHub Desktop (though unfortunately you might not be able to install this program)
- Delete the file and re-upload a updated version to the same location (this would be bad for track management and version history).
