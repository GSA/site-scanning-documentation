In order to more efficiently operate the federal web space, it makes sense to analyze the current webspace with an eye to reducing and coalescing them.  This proposal articulates several frameworks to do so and how to use Site Scanning data in the process.  

### Low traffic sites

Digital Analytics Program (DAP) data provides website traffic for much of the federal web presence.

There are several ways to interact with this data.  

1) For a higher level, visual experience, go to https://analytics.usa.gov/visualizations and use the drop down to select an agency.  Then, you can click within the graphic to drill down further and further.  This is a helpful starting point, but likely not good for fine grain analysis.
2) Perhaps the easiest yet still substantive route is to begin at https://analytics.usa.gov/data, then download the [Top Hostnames CSV](https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/top-100000-domains-30-days.csv) and open it in sheets or excel.  There is again an agency dropdown at the top of the page, which allows one to filter for an agency and then download the Top Hostnames CSV specific to that agency.  

- Any federal employee can gain direct access to the data in DAP [here](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/get-started-with-dap#step-1-register-as-a-dap-user).  Once you gain access, perhaps the most useful page is the [Domains Report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/p393249053/reports/explorer?params=_u..nav%3Dmaui&ruid=19233ACB-2A11-4B0A-9D71-E45EBCE91AA3&collectionId=5935400244&r=6668527931).  



Caveats:  

Seasonal changes in traffic are important to factor in.  Does a candidate website have a certain time of year where their usage is focused and thus only a partial view of a year's traffic wouldn't reflect its true use?  The Google Analytics report page allows one to select for the past 12 months but even then a specific candidate should be further inspected to guard against this.   




### Out of date sites 



### Duplicative or overlapping sites 



### Disproportionately Expensive 


### Out of Scope for an Agency

#### Classify Sites 
- Create a new file or overlap with the federal website directory to promulgage a labelling system with these categories:
  - Content, Application, Public Service, Internal, Infrastructure
