After [a good bit of analysis and consideration](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/about/project-management/proposals/agency-bureau-list.md), I believe that the [OPM Federal Agencies List dataset](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/open-government/Data/Apps/Agencies/) is the best option for a consistent list and naming convention to use.  

## Advantanges

- The dataset comes from an authoritative source and is available as a machine-readable file.
- Comparisons of the dataset against alternatives show it to have a good balance between being comprehensive but not overly inclusive.  


## Disadvantages 

- The names are in all caps.
- There's currently a bug that causes names that have a hyphen to drop everything after that character.
- The Army, Navy, and Air Force are framed as peers of Defense instead of subcomponents.
- Legislative and Judicial agencies are not included.  


## Alternatives 
- OMB List of Agency and Bureau Codes - [OMB Circular A-11, Appendix C](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf#page=849)
- _(Others listed [here](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/about/project-management/proposals/agency-bureau-list.md#details))_

## Possible Users

- Site Scanning
- dotgov.gov
- Digital Analytics Program



## Notes 
- (We should drop the 'Bureau' framing)
