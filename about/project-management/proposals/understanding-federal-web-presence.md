There's a persisting, recurring need to quantify the federal government and federal web presence, for the sake of understanding the market and for tracking adoption and market coverage.  This memo seeks to unpack that and propose some models for doing so.  

## How many federal agencies are there?  

TL;DR: 

There is not one authoritative source for this.  In fact, [there's over 10 reasonable options to choose from](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/about/project-management/proposals/agency-bureau-list.md).  And no one source is best suited for our needs.  




The main issues are: 
- Under-inclusion of "agencies": There are good authoritative lists of agencies, but their primary flaw is relegating to bureau status what many people would think of as an agency.  This is principally an issue with Cabinet departments.  Specifically, the "Department of X" is considered an agency, 
- Over-inclusion of "bureaus":
- Completeness: Some lists are a good compromise of the above factors, but for various reasons only cover parts of the federal government.  



What I would propose is to decide on a colloquial definition of an agency and a bureau and think about how the terms could be applied successfully.  


Notes: 
- 



## How many federal websites are there?  

TL;DR:  


## How many federal domains are there?  

TL;DR:  


## How many subagencies are there?  

TL;DR:  







Proposal 1: 

We should use the .gov registry's dataset of registered domains (snapshot in sheets) for: 
- Number of agencies: currently 149
- Number of subagencies: currently 577
- Number of domains: currently 1373
- And we should use a new metric for counting live, unique websites that'll actually be ready any day now.  Will update when it's ready.  
We're going to start up a new federal-web-presence report that will keep these numbers up to date and can add any other fields if desired.  
The reason we should use these numbers is because there's no single better alternative, and generating and maintaining our own is a recipe for madness.
