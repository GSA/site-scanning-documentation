In order to best be scanned by the Site Scanning program, each website would need to ensure the following:
- Ensure HTTPS 
- Ensure that the base domain works both with or without www. In other words, both https://www.x.gov and https://x.gov resolve and one redirects to the other.
- For subdomains, if www. is used it cannot be required. In other words, if https://www.something.agency.gov exists, the www. should not be required (https://something.agency.gov should work for a user).
- A website should have a live homepage at its root. In other words, if there is live content anywhere on a website (e.g. at https://program.gov/something/somethingelse), then the site should have a homepage (e.g. at https://program.gov).
- Our IP Addresses may need to be whitelisted: 
  - 52.222.122.97/32
  - 52.222.123.172/32
