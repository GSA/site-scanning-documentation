| Build federal website index                   | Wednesday, 10 PM UTC  | https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-list.yml             | https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/actions  | This action builds the target URL list using [this list of sources](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/builder/config.py) and [these instructions](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/builder/__main__.py) and saves it [here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/site-scanning-target-url-list.csv), along with an analysis file containing metadata about the list creation process [here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/site-scanning-target-url-list-analysis.csv). Various snapshot files are generated at each step of the build process in order to serve as breadcrumbs and are saved [here](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/tree/main/data/snapshots).  |
| Analyze snapshot and target URL list analyses | Thursday, 10 PM UTC   | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-all-analysis.yml | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/actions | This action creates three analysis reports in [this directory](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/tree/main/reports). These reports analyze: (1) the target URL list, (2) the primary snapshot that contains all live sites scanned, and (3) the "all" snapshot that contains all sites scanned.                                      |
| Ingest federal website index                  | tk                    | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/ingest.yml                  | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/actions   | This action prompts the scanning engine to ingest the target URL list, thereby updating the websites to be scanned, and removing invalid websites that are no longer present in the dataset.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Enqueue websites for scanning                 | Daily at 12:10 AM UTC | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/enqueue-scans.yml           | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/actions   | This action prompts the scanning engine to add every website to the scanning queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Produce snapshots                             | Sunday, 12 AM UTC     | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-snapshot.yml         | https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-engine/actions   | This action produces the CSV and JSON snapshots of the site scanning engine's most recent scan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
