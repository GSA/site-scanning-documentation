### Different definitions for what is a website

##### GSA Internal Guidance

“Website” means any site, web-enabled system, or digital service a customer, partner, or stakeholder accesses through any domain listed on the DotGov registry, including subdomains of those domains not listed on the registry.
The definition of “website” does not include the following:

Domains used strictly for APIs.
Domains used solely for email distribution.
Domains used solely for staging functionality or content for testing or review prior to going into production.
Domains that perform a HTTP 30x redirect and do not serve content.
Domains used to host image, video, or data content consumed by other sites, and which do not have their own index, home, or gallery page.
“Intranet” means any internal platform that primarily provides unrestricted access to information for GSA employees. This includes Google sites that are open to all GSA employees. It does not include Google sites that are private, meaning specific individuals or groups have access.
