### Different definitions for what is a website

##### GSA Internal Guidance

“Website” means any site, web-enabled system, or digital service a customer, partner, or stakeholder accesses through any domain listed on the DotGov registry, including subdomains of those domains not listed on the registry.
The definition of “website” does not include the following:

Domains used strictly for APIs.
Domains used solely for email distribution.
Domains used solely for staging functionality or content for testing or review prior to going into production.
Domains that perform a HTTP 30x redirect and do not serve content.
Domains used to host image, video, or data content consumed by other sites, and which do not have their own index, home, or gallery page.
“Intranet” means any internal platform that primarily provides unrestricted access to information for GSA employees. This includes Google sites that are open to all GSA employees. It does not include Google sites that are private, meaning specific individuals or groups have access.

Federal Agency public websites and digital services** are defined here as online information resources or services maintained in whole or in part by the departments and agencies in the Executive Branch of the U.S. Federal Government that are operated by an agency, contractor, or other organization on behalf of the agency.

support the proper performance of an agency function.

A website is a collection of web pages typically related by a topic, an organization, a commercial interest, or a government agency. It may contain text, images, videos, audio files, and other content, all of which is delivered under the same base URL (e.g., companyname.com, office.gov, orgname.org).

##### [Archive.org](https://blog.archive.org/2016/10/23/defining-web-pages-web-sites-and-web-captures/)

We define a webpage as a valid web capture that is an HTML document, a plain text document, or a PDF.

A domain on the web is an owned section of the internet namespace, such as google.com or archive.org or bbc.co.uk. 

A host on the web is identified by a fully qualified domain name or FQDN that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System. The FQDN consists of the following parts: hostname and domain name.  As an example, in case of the host blog.archive.org, its hostname is blog and the host is located within the domain archive.org.

We define a website to be a host that has served webpages and has at least one incoming link from a webpage belonging to a different domain.
