The Site Scanning program maintains a number of automated processes that, together, consitute the entire project and seek to deliver useful data.  The basic flow of these events are as follows: 

- Each week, a comprehensive list of public federal .gov websites is assembled as the [Federal Website Index](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/site-scanning-target-url-list.csv).
  - [Process description](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index#summary-of-methodology), including details about the sources used, how the list is combined, and which criteria are used to remove entries.
  - [Snapshots from each step in the assembly process](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/tree/main/data/snapshots#readme), including which URLs are removed at each step and which remain.  
  - [Data dictionary](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/data/Target_URL_List_Data_Dictionary.csv) for the Federal Website Index.
  - [Analysis report for the assembly process](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/site-scanning-target-url-list-analysis.csv).
  - [Analysis report for the completed Federal Website Index](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/reports/target-URL-list.csv).
- Every day, the Federal Website Index is then scanned.  This is done by loading each Target URL in a virtual browser and noting the results.  This information then populates the primary Site Scanning database.
  - [Scanning process description](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/pages/scan_steps.md), including what criteria are used to create each field of data.
  - [Data dictionary](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/data/Site_Scanning_Data_Dictionary.csv) for the Site Scanning data.
- The resulting information is stored in a database that is [queryable via API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api/), but each week, a series of static snapshot of the data is generated and [made available](https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api/#download-the-data-directly) as CSV and JSON files.
  - The ['All' snapshot](https://api.gsa.gov/technology/site-scanning/data/weekly-snapshot-all.csv) includes every URL in the Federal Website Index.  
  - The ['Primary' snapshot](https://api.gsa.gov/technology/site-scanning/data/weekly-snapshot.csv) is a subset of the initial snapshot and includes only live URLs.  This is likely the best starting point for most users.
  - The ['Unique Final URL' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/unique_website_list/results/weekly-snapshot-unique-final-urls.csv) then further trims the Primary snapshot by removing duplicative Final URLs ([details](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/tree/main/unique_website_list/results#readme)).
  - The ['Unique Final Website' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/unique_website_list/results/weekly-snapshot-unique-final-websites.csv) then finally trims the Unique Final URL snapshot by removing duplicative Final URL - Base Websites ([details](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/tree/main/unique_website_list/results#readme)). 
- After these snapshots are generated, a series of reports are run that analyze or pull information out of them.
  - [Analysis report of the 'All' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/reports/snapshot-all.csv)
  - [Analysis report of the 'Primary' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/reports/snapshot-primary.csv)
  - [Analysis report for the 'Unique Final URL' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/reports/unique-url.csv)
  - [Analysis report for the 'Unique Final Website' snapshot](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning-analysis/blob/main/reports/unique-website.csv)
