## What is the criteria for inclusion in the Federal Website Index, and thus the Site Scanning data?  




## A public federal .gov website is missing from the Federal Website Index and the Site Scanning Data.  How can I add it?  

Please email [site-scanning@gsa.gov](mailto:site-scanning@gsa.gov) with any websites that are missing that you think should be added!  We will add them to [this file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/data/dataset/other-websites.csv), which will ensure that they are ingested in the weekly index rebuilding.   

## You include a website which should be filtered out.  How can I have it removed from the Federal Website Index and thus from the Site Scanning data?  

Please email [site-scanning@gsa.gov](mailto:site-scanning@gsa.gov) with any websites that are missing that you think should be removed! We will then add them to [this file](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index/blob/main/criteria/ignore-list-begins.csv), which will ensure that they are filtered out in the weekly index rebuilding.
